# Psychic-Game

The game generates a random letter, which can be viewed with the "inspect" function.  
The user's guesses are displayed in the screen, and if they guess the comp's number, an alert is triggered. 
The alert informs the player that s/he has won.  If s/he wins; "Wins" will increase by 1, the game resets and the computer will generate a new letter for the player to guess.  If s/he loses, the game also resets, and the computer generates a new letter.  Losses will then increase by 1.
